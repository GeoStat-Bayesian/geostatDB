<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of geostatDB is to provide a unified interface for R packages to databases containing geostatistical data, with a focus on subsurface applications. Currently, we support the World-Wide Hydrological Parameters DAtabase, the largest open-access database for hydrogeological paramters.

## Installation

geostatDB is not ye on CRAN. You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GeoStat-Bayesian/geostatDB")
```
## Example

For an example of the package, we refer to the vignette.
